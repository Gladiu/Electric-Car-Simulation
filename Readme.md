__**TODO:**__
```
	-Find a way to approximate track with bezier curves
		-Test with one curve
		-Test with entire track
	-Calculate limit speed at which corner can be taken
	-Calculate speeds at which entire track can be passed
```

In branch bezier try to read from .png file a curve and approximate it with bezier equations
